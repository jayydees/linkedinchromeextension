📸 SCREENSHOTS GUIDE - Super Simple!
=====================================

Good news: You already have GREAT screenshots! 🎉

The screenshots you showed me are perfect. Here's what to do:

STEP 1: Prepare Your Screenshots
---------------------------------
You need 3-5 screenshots showing the extension in action.

From your images, you should upload:

1. ✅ Full LinkedIn page with extension panel visible (the one with posts on left, panel on right)
2. ✅ Close-up of the extension panel showing all features
3. ✅ Extension with labels applied to posts (showing the label pills)

Optional (if you want more):
4. Search feature in action
5. Pinned posts view


STEP 2: Screenshot Requirements
--------------------------------
Chrome Web Store accepts:
- Size: 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels
- Format: JPEG or PNG (PNG recommended)
- File size: Under 5MB each
- No alpha/transparency

Your current screenshots look perfect for this!


STEP 3: How to Prepare Screenshots
-----------------------------------

Option A - Use As-Is (Easiest):
1. The screenshots you already have are probably fine!
2. Just crop them to remove any personal info
3. Save as PNG

Option B - Take New Screenshots (If needed):
1. Open extension on LinkedIn saved posts page
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P
4. Type "screenshot"
5. Select "Capture screenshot"
6. Saves automatically!

Option C - Crop Existing (If too big):
1. Open your screenshot in any image editor (Paint, Preview, etc.)
2. Crop to 1280x800 (or just crop out personal info)
3. Save as PNG


STEP 4: What Makes Good Screenshots
------------------------------------
✅ Show the extension in action
✅ Highlight key features (labels, pins, notes, search)
✅ Clear, readable text
✅ No personal/sensitive information
✅ Professional looking

❌ Don't include your personal LinkedIn posts (blur if needed)
❌ Don't show your profile info
❌ Don't make it too cluttered


STEP 5: Upload to Chrome Web Store
-----------------------------------
1. Go to your draft listing
2. Scroll to "Screenshots" section
3. Click "Drop image here" or "+"
4. Upload your 3-5 screenshots
5. You can reorder them by dragging
6. First screenshot is the most important (shown in search results)


SUGGESTED SCREENSHOT ORDER:
---------------------------
1st: Full page view (panel + LinkedIn posts) - Shows context
2nd: Extension panel close-up - Shows features clearly
3rd: Labels in action - Shows organization feature
4th (optional): Search being used
5th (optional): Pinned posts view
