🎨 STEP 1: GENERATE ICONS
========================

1. Find this file in your folder:
   📄 create-icons.html

2. Double-click it (it opens in your web browser)

3. You'll see a webpage with 3 "Download" buttons

4. Click each button to download:
   - icon16.png
   - icon48.png
   - icon128.png

5. Save all 3 files into the "icons" folder

IMPORTANT: Make sure all 3 PNG files are in the icons/ folder:
   📁 icons/
   ├── icon.svg      ← Already there
   ├── icon16.png    ← You need to download this
   ├── icon48.png    ← You need to download this
   └── icon128.png   ← You need to download this

Once done, move to STEP-2.txt
